The following error with errorcode 0x80090350 occurred while using Negotiate authentication: An unknown security error occurred.  \r\n Possible causes are:\r\n  -The user name or password specified are invalid.\r\n  -Kerberos is used when no authentication method and no user name are specified.\r\n  -Kerberos accepts domain user names, but not local user names.\r\n  -The Service Principal Name (SPN) for the remote computer name and port does not exist.\r\n  -The client and remote computers are in different domains and there is no trust between the two domains.\r\n After checking for the above issues, try the following:\r\n  -Check the Event Viewer for events related to authentication.\r\n  -Change the authentication method; add the destination computer to the WinRM TrustedHosts configuration setting or use HTTPS transport.\r\n Note that computers in the TrustedHosts list might not be authenticated.\r\n   -For more information about WinRM configuration, run the following command: winrm help config."
